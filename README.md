## 📌 About
This repository will host the official implementation of our ICCV 2025 paper:  
**Occlusion-robust Stylization for Drawing-based 3D Animation**.  

We propose a novel framework for **stylizing 3D animations from 2D drawings** that is robust to **occlusion artifacts**, enabling consistent and visually appealing results across challenging scenarios.
